<p><b>10 tips to improve your photography skills</b></p><p>1- Visit
your neighbourhood</p><p>You don’t have to travel thousand miles to make beautiful shots. What
you’ve to do is just going few step away from your home.</p><p>It doesn't  matter if you’re living in a city, town or village. All those
places give you great space for creativity.</p><p>For example, if you live in a city, you may enjoy street photography,
walking through people, taking pictures at different angles, or you may want to
explore what there is around, a small green park, an abandoned train station,
walls with graffiti, a small forest. The shapes of the nature will give you
infinite possibilities.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/48857a39-27b8-491a-baa8-194512998de6.jpg" alt="" title=""><p>2- Take
your camera always with you</p><p>Yes, take it everywhere. If you should go to work with the car or with
the train, wake up early and explore your itinerary, stop in some
nice places. The most beautiful shoots are unpredictable. You can find anything in your way, and you will grateful to have your gear with you.</p><picture>

<p>3- Look
at the best example </p><p>Not everyone is the same, we are attracted by
beauty in different ways. Each of us has his own concept about it. Find out there someone that
through his pictures gives you emotion. On Internet you will find talented
photographers, just find yours and try to imitate, to get in contact, to read
about him, about his history. You will develop your styles and you will be amazed about your progress. For instance, my favorites are Dani Diamond and Sean Archer. Checkout their works in 500px. If you like portrait/fashion photography like I do, you'll be amazed.</p><picture>

<p>4- Be
always curious</p><p>Go behind the information you will acquire, try to figure out what's the best for your style. Customize all your new discoveries, try to answer all your questions, be interested in improving your own creative talent. There is unlimited knowledge out there you can use to improve
your technique. Don't be too perfectionist or you'll never start. Grab your creativity and make yourself an artist, discover your inner soul. You will find power and ideas you were never aware of.</p><picture>

<p>5- Use
the rules, brake the rules</p><p>OK, I know the most important things in photography
are rules. But forget them for a while and use your eyes. Also your eyes are very special. Through them you enjoy life, seeing art and with them you explore this wonderful World. </p><p>Start from the rules, get your idea and be revolutionary. You can build your network, your own brand. Your style.</p><p>In another article this blog is going to show about those rules in detail, but please after have your own idea, try to find your time to relax and enjoy the beautiful experience to create an artwork.</p><picture>

<p>6- Socialize</p><p>Yes, you should think about socializing, get a feedback from the crowd. Meet people. There are hundreds folks out there that have something in common with you: the passion for photography, and they want to improve themselves in it, like you also want. So, the question is, how to find those people and meet? Well, there are groups in any city using social platform like <a href="http://meetup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meetup.com</a> or <a href="http://internations.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internations.org</a>. Just google it and you'll see. You can even create your own group and became an ambassador, make your events and start to meet new friends that will share ideas and experience.</p><picture>

<p>7- Be
creative</p><p>I always have in my mind a Turkish character called Cevat Kelle, a cameraman with his thousand stuff with him. In our mind we always prefer the concept "the more the merrier",  carrying with us 6 lenses, a big tripod, strobes and reflectors. But I would say.. this is the best way to give up soon!.. You will be very tired carrying lots of kilos around and you will forget about the real reason you got a camera, you will forget about your passion, because it will become too complicated and exhausting. Then, just start easy!!  "Less is better", take the most basic gear and go out in action. For instance a wonderful 50mm with a basic reflex will do a great job. Even with a good smartphone you can survive. OK don't kill me for this last comment, I will demonstrate you I'm right, but if you don't believe me stop to think you should have the greatest and most expensive gears with you to make the most beautiful pictures. This is totally false. You're the photographer and you have already the most advanced tool for a great result. Your imagination and your eyes! Here you will find thousands of  examples of beautiful pictures taken using a phone. Use your creativity always. If you need a tripod, use a natural one, a bench, a rock, whatever can be useful, if you need light, try to use the natural one. There is no better flash than the sun, and combined with your eyes, the most advanced technology you've always with you, the result is granted.</p><picture>

<p>8- Think
out of the box</p><p>That's all about your creativity. Go out and experiment different things, try unusual angles, explore different shapes. Be aware, outside there is a world to discover. Be inspired by others, but think always on your own. The best exercise for this is only one, that makes all photographer better photographer. Listen to your favorite music. Music is inspiring and giving you ideas that you cannot even imagine. It can be a bit peculiar find this as advice in a photography blog, but you will notice the difference when you will start using music, while you're making landscape photography or you're editing a portrait. </p><picture>

<p>9- Find
your best passion and go for it </p><p>Try to figure out, what will be your best shots. What you would love to make immortal. There are different fields and each of them requires different skills and learning path. For instance if you love fashion photography or portraiture you will need to understand how to use the light, edit a picture and which kind of gear combination gives you the best results. Instead if your interest is landscape photography you must also have a look which filters to use, how build a great composition, study the environment and catch the best moment for the shooting. All those things are requiring passion and study. You've to prepare your personal journey and set your goals. More deep you will go, more you'll understand what's your best passion.</p><picture>
